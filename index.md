## About Me

I am a Computer Engineering student with strong foundation in a variety of programming languages as well as hardware design. I have knowledge in a variety of programming languages including:

* **Java**
* **C/C++**
* **JavaScript**
* **HTML**
* **SQL**
* **Python**

I also have experience in engineering related software such as:

* **SolidWorks**
* **Microsoft Office**
* **AutoCAD**
* **MATLAB**
* **Logisim**
* **Multisim**
* **LTspice**

When I am not tinkering with electronic DIY projects, I am often hiking with friends enjoying what nature has to offer.
## Mechatronics

## Video Card
**Purpose:**
<dd>This video was implemented using a variety of circuit elements, including: binary counters, hex inverters, NAND gates, and a 10MHz oscillator. The card is designed to output a resolution of 800x600 pixels and with additional programming as well as an EPROM (electronic programmable read only memmory) it is fully capable of displaying still pictures.</dd>

## 8-Bit Virtual Adder
**Purpose:**
<dd>The composed circuit was designed with LASI software and required multiple layers of circuitry to be created. THe circuit began at the most basic level, with the formation of p-wells and n-well, and was then connected to the upper levels with the use of via metals. The LASI software was able to automatically generate Verilog code, and after tinkering with parasitic capacitances and variable voltages, the circuit outputs were graphed in LTspice to confirm functionality.</dd>

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
