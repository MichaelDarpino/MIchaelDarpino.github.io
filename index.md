## Video Card
**Purpose:**
<dd>This video was implemented using a variety of circuit elements, including: binary counters, hex inverters, NAND gates, and a 10MHz oscillator. The card is designed to output a resolution of 800x600 pixels and with additional programming as well as an EPROM (electronic programmable read only memmory) it is fully capable of displaying still pictures.</dd>

*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
